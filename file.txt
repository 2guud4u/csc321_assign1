This talk is about career growth. I once did a project near the New Mexico border with a guy named Billy, who had come up with a great innovation for progressive cavity pump artificial lift. Billy’s voice sounded like gravel baked in Marlboros. This was pre-Webex days, so on the phone during invention stage-gate talks I always pictured him as a wiry guy, but in person he was a big dude - a stocky 6’-1”, probably 230 lbs., with a mountain-man mustache.

Billy is a great guy. When we met, he walked me around the field office, which had as much taxidermy per square foot as a Bass Pro Shops, which was in violation of about three of our corporate edicts - but we were far enough away from Houston that it didn’t matter.
